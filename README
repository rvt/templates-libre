This project aims to provide a template for Open Source project that wants to
use Jahia is there CMS.



For installation of Jahia please go to http://www.jahia.org.

TO compile this template you need to have teh following tools installed:

- maven2 or maven3
- Java JDK 1.6



The settings.example.xml file is based of Jahia trunk r38009,
you might need to get a new version from there SVN repository if
the compile doesn't work anymore. http://subversion.jahia.org/svn/jahia/trunk


To compile the templates-libre template to a war file copy
settings.example.xml to ~/.m2/settings.xml  and modify
to your needs. In most case you only need to modify the following settings:

<localRepository>/home/<USER>/.m2</localRepository>
and
<jahia.deploy.targetServerDirectory>/opt/Jahia_xCM_v6.5-SNAPSHOT/tomcat</jahia.deploy.targetServerDirectory>

After you modified you need to run build.sh

When teh compilation is successfull, and I hope it will be copy the
generated war file in the target directory to the following directory:
ROOT/WEB-INF/var/shared_modules

When jahia is set to delveopment mode it will autimatically deploy the template,
if you didn't enable development mode you need to restart your applicaiton server.


if you have any questions, please don't hessitate and mail me at: templates-libre@rvt.dds.nl
